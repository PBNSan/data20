## How can I run the Windows version of Excel on my Mac? 

The macOS version of Excel provides the features the course requires. However, the interface of the Mac version differs from that of the Windows version. If you have trouble following in-class examples while using a Mac, you may wish to run the Windows version of Excel.

To run Excel for Windows on your Mac, you have two broad options. First, you can run Windows within macOS using a virtualization tool. Second, you can use Apple's Boot Camp tool to run Windows directly on your Mac.

Virtualization allows you to access Windows applications without restarting your computer. Modern virtualization packages include Oracle VirtualBox, VMWare Fusion, and Parallels. I recommend starting with VirtualBox since it is free.

In contrast to virtualization, Boot Camp requires you to reboot your Mac before accessing Windows. Running Windows directly (i.e., not as a virtual machine within a host operating system) offers higher performance. However, the inconvenience of rebooting your computer to switch between macOS and Windows, coupled with the excellent performance of modern virtual machines, makes virtualization the better route for most users.

To run Windows and Excel within VirtualBox, follow the steps below.

1.  Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and run the VirtualBox installer.

2.  Download Microsoft Windows 10 via [Microsoft Imagine](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_cs=1&cmi_mnuMain=bdba23cf-e05e-e011-971f-0030487d8897&ws=f2f4cf67-44b9-e511-9414-b8ca3a5db7a1&vsro=8&pc=0dafd5cd-4c09-e011-bed1-0030487d8897).

3.  Follow [these directions](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/198427-how-to-install-windows-10-in-a-virtual-machine) to setup Windows 10 within VirtualBox.

4.  Use BuckeyeMail to [download Microsoft Office](https://osuitsm.service-now.com/selfservice/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=kb04733) and run the Office installer.
